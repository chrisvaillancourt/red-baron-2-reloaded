# Decision log

Significant project decisions, newest at the bottom. Each entry: context,
decision, consequences. Agents append here when they make a call that
another contributor would otherwise have to rediscover.

## D-001 — Platform: browser game in TypeScript + Three.js
**Context.** The goal is a playable modern rebuild of Dynamix's *Red Baron II*
(1997), built by AI agents on macOS, with no asset store or engine licence.
**Decision.** A single-page web game: TypeScript, Three.js (r186) for
WebGL2 rendering, Vite for dev/build, Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for
browser smoke tests and screenshot-driven visual QA. No UI framework: plain
DOM + CSS for menus and HUD.
**Consequences.** Runs with `pnpm dev` and any modern browser; trivially
shareable as static files (`pnpm build`). Sim/campaign logic is pure TS and
testable in Node. We give up native-engine niceties (physics engine, editor).

## D-002 — Stay true to RB2's gameplay pillars
**Decision.** The rebuild keeps what defined RB2:
1. **Career mode** as the heart: German, British, French or American pilot;
   start any date from mid-1915 to late 1918; historical squadrons,
   aircraft availability by date, promotions, medals, wounds, capture, death,
   fame and newspaper notices; the historical aces flying (and dying) on
   their historical schedule, and sometimes appearing in your sky.
2. **Mission variety**: patrols, escort, intercept, balloon busting/defence,
   ground attack, airfield attack, free hunts.
3. **Quick missions / single missions** for instant dogfights against chosen
   types, numbers, skill levels and named aces.
4. **Authentic-feeling flight**: rotary torque, stalls and spins, fragile
   airframes (Albatros lower wing), gun jams, Lewis drum changes, limited
   ammunition — each individually toggleable in realism settings.
5. **Padlock view** and the classic view set (cockpit, chase, fly-by,
   target), time compression, wingman orders, "end flight" when safe.
**Modernisations.** Real-time 3D terrain with streamed LOD, dynamic
lighting/sky/clouds, particle effects; mouse-aim flying option and gamepad
support; relaxed/standard/authentic flight-model presets; autosave; HUD
target cues (toggleable); rebindable keys; procedural audio.

## D-003 — Asset strategy: generated, not sourced
**Decision.** No third-party art. Aircraft 3D models are generated
procedurally by a parametric Blender pipeline (`tools/blender/`, headless
Blender 5.2 via `blender --background`) from `src/data/aircraft.ts` geometry
and exported as glTF binaries to `public/models/`. Liveries/insignia are
applied at runtime (canvas textures) so squadron and personal colours need
no extra files. Menu/briefing art is rendered by Blender to `public/art/`.
Terrain, clouds, effects and ground objects are procedural in Three.js.
Audio is synthesised in WebAudio at runtime (no sample files).
**Consequences.** The repo is self-contained and licence-clean. Model
regeneration is one command. If a GLB is missing the runtime falls back to a
procedural mesh built from the same geometry spec, so the game never blocks
on the art pipeline.

## D-004 — Coordinate frames and units
**Decision.** SI units throughout. World: +X east, +Y up, −Z north; heading 0
= north, clockwise positive. Aircraft body: forward −Z, up +Y, right +X (the
Three.js camera convention, so a camera parented to the aircraft looks
forward). Blender models are authored nose → Blender +Y, top → +Z, right
wing → +X; the glTF exporter's Y-up conversion then yields body frame directly.
**Consequences.** No per-model rotation fixups; physics, rendering and
cameras share one frame.

## D-005 — One real-scale sector of the Western Front
**Decision.** A single theatre at 1:1 scale: Flanders–Artois–Somme, roughly
49.6°N–51.1°N, 1.9°E–3.9°E (~143 × 168 km), equirectangular projection
around Arras (`src/core/geo.ts`). Real towns, rivers, historical aerodromes
and front lines that move with the date (1915 static lines, 1916 Somme,
1917 Hindenburg Line/Arras/Cambrai, 1918 Spring Offensive and Hundred Days).
**Consequences.** Authentic geography and distances (aerodromes 10–25 km
behind the lines) with a manageable world. Squadrons historically based
elsewhere are handled by D-006.

## D-006 — Rebasing squadrons that fought outside the sector
**Decision.** Some iconic units fought elsewhere on the front (e.g. the US
94th "Hat in the Ring" at Toul). For gameplay they are rebased onto sector
aerodromes and flagged `rebased: true` in `src/data/aerodromes.ts`.
**Consequences.** Every nation offers its famous squadrons; the rebasing is
documented rather than hidden.

## D-007 — Parallel development via worktree-isolated agents
**Decision.** Subsystems are built by parallel agents, each in its own git
worktree and owning a disjoint directory. Contracts live in `src/core/` and
are the only shared surface; the lead merges branches into `main`. Agents
commit as they complete work.
**Consequences.** Contract changes require coordination through the lead;
agents stub what they need behind the interfaces rather than editing another
module.

## D-008 — Naming
**Decision.** Working title *Red Baron II: Reloaded*, a non-commercial fan
rebuild. No original Dynamix/Sierra assets, code, or trademarks-as-branding
beyond the title homage.

## D-009 — Audio: pre-rendered synthesis + WebAudio graph, not AudioWorklets
**Context.** D-003 rules out sample files; engine sounds must track rpm for
up to seven aircraft at once without glitching.
**Decision.** Sounds are synthesised in pure TypeScript into buffers at
startup (`src/audio/synthBuffers.ts`), then played through a normal WebAudio
node graph. Engines are pre-rendered exhaust-pulse loops played at
`playbackRate = rpm / 1200`, with per-type profiles (rotary9 / inline6 / v8 /
v12). Doppler is applied as a pitch factor, since WebAudio removed its own.
The master bus ends in a compressor plus soft clipper. Music is original,
written in a small text notation and played by synthesised instruments.
**Consequences.** No AudioWorklet or Blob-URL module loading, so it works
anywhere WebAudio does and the synthesis is unit-testable in Node. Startup
pays about 100 ms to render the flight bank (`warmUp()`). Timbre scales a
little with rpm because the whole loop is resampled, which suits engines.

## D-010 — Historical simplifications in the career data
**Context.** The aircraft roster starts in mid-1915 but lacks several types
squadrons actually flew (SE5, D.H.5, Morane, B.E.2, 1½ Strutter).
**Decision.** Squadron start dates are moved to when a rostered type arrives
(No. 56 Sqn enters play 1 June 1917 with the S.E.5a, skipping its SE5
period; No. 24 Sqn goes from D.H.2 straight to S.E.5a, skipping the D.H.5).
Where a side has no rostered type of a role yet (Allied scouts and two-seaters
before 1916; two-seaters before late 1916/1917), AI flights use the earliest
rostered type of that role as a stand-in. The Lafayette Escadrille (N.124) is
modelled as a US squadron so American careers can begin in 1916; it transfers
to the 103rd Aero on 18 February 1918. JG I's later 1918 moves off-map (the
Marne) are replaced by in-sector fields.
**Consequences.** Every nation/date has a playable squadron; a few squadrons
fly a type a few weeks early or late.

## D-011 — Career consequences are pilot-local
**Decision.** Killing or capturing a historical ace in a career records it in
`CareerPilot.alteredAces` (additive optional field); that ace stops scoring
and never reappears in that career. History otherwise runs on schedule
(aces die on their historical dates). Squadron mates are a deterministic
quarterly roster (seed + squadron + quarter), not persisted individuals.
**Consequences.** No shared "world state" to migrate between careers; mates
turn over every three months rather than tracking individual losses.

## D-012 — Wounds resolve immediately
**Decision.** A wound sets `status: 'hospital'` and `hospitalDays`, and the
career date jumps past the stay at once. The next `generateMission` returns
the pilot to `active`. The UI can show "returned from hospital" while the
status is `hospital`.

## D-013 — AI flies through the same controls as the player
**Context.** AI pilots could be kinematic (set position/velocity directly) or
fly the real flight model.
**Decision.** AI writes only `ControlInputs`; the same `stepFlight` flies AI and
player aircraft. A layered controller (autopilot → tactics → mission) sits on
top: a bank-to-turn autopilot with a PI loop on measured g, line-of-sight
feed-forward, and stall/terrain protection built only from `FlightState`.
**Consequences.** AI obeys the same performance, stalls, torque and damage as
the player (a D.VII really out-climbs a Camel; a damaged engine really forces
the AI home). Gains need retuning when the flight model changes; the point-mass
test model and robustness tests keep the controller tolerant of that.

## D-014 — Continuous skill scale and period tactics
**Decision.** Skill is a continuous 0..1 value (novice 0, regular 0.35,
veteran 0.7, ace 1) so `enemySkillBias` can shift it. Aircraft are tagged
turn fighters or energy fighters; energy fighters boom-and-zoom, turn fighters
stay in the turn. Aces gain height before engaging and approach two-seaters
from below the observer's gun. Threat assessment weighs aspect (enemy on our
tail vs a head-on pass) so experienced pilots don't break from every nose
pointed their way.

## D-015 — Flight model: calibrated lumped polar in an acceleration-form 6-DOF
**Context.** WWI types must feel distinct and match their history, but full
per-panel aerodynamics with real inertia tensors is hard to tune for 23
aircraft with sparse data.
**Decision.** Forces come from one lumped wing polar per type; moments use
stiffness/damping/authority per unit dynamic pressure derived from the spec's
`rollRate`/`pitchRate`, with physical couplings (torque, gyroscopic
precession, dihedral, adverse yaw) layered on. Three parameters per type
(`cd0`, propeller design speed, power-lapse exponent) are solved so max
speed, climb to 3000 m and ceiling reproduce `performance`; a Vitest suite
flies every aircraft to prove it. The stick commands angle of attack, which
gives natural speed stability, accelerated stalls and g-loads.
**Consequences.** Adding an aircraft needs only historical figures. Handling
is deterministic and cheap (~0.7 µs/step). Two data points were corrected
where the model could not reach them physically: Dr.I climb 7.5 → 8.5 min,
D.VIII max speed 204 → 190 km/h (the 204 km/h figure belongs to a more
powerful engine).

## D-016 — Spins are a latched mode, not emergent inertia coupling
**Decision.** A spin is entered from a stall with yaw rate (authentic: any
uncoordinated stall; standard: only with pro-spin rudder held; relaxed:
never) and holds deep-stall alpha and autorotation until recovery inputs are
held (forward stick + opposite rudder ~1.5 s on authentic).
**Consequences.** Spins are reliable, teachable and recoverable instead of
depending on fragile inertia-coupling tuning.

## D-017 — Combat conventions
**Decision.** Rounds pass through fabric and damage every zone on their path
until the engine stops them; kill credit goes to the last attacker when a loss
(including structural failure, crash or ditching) follows a hit within 30 s;
rear gunners on two-seaters auto-engage with skill-based error (AI may
override the target); archie is generated from the front line, enemy balloons
and AA-gun ground targets rather than placed batteries; `controls.clearJam` is
consumed by the combat system (one hammer blow per press).
**Consequences.** Forced-down victories count as in RB2; mission designers get
flak "for free" near the lines; the input layer only has to set the flag on key
press edges.

## D-XXX — AI flies by inverting the sim's control laws
**Context.** The AI autopilot was built as a model-agnostic PID law on a
point-mass stand-in. On the real 6-DOF model (stick commands AoA, roll rate ∝ V)
fixed gains went unstable at high speed (no dive pull-outs, wings shed) and
porpoised when aiming (the nose leads the flight path by the AoA, which grows with
g).
**Decision.** `src/ai` reads `getCoefficients` and inverts the sim's pitch and
roll laws (with pitch-damping lag compensation and small PI trims), caps the aim
gain from dα/dn, and governs dives against the sim's Vne and gLimit. The generic
PID law is kept behind `controlLaw: 'generic'` for the point-mass tests. AI
traits (stall speed and AoA, Vne, gLimit, best-climb speed) come from the sim, not
from separate estimates.
**Consequences.** `src/ai` depends on `src/sim/coefficients` and `stickForAlpha`
(pure modules). Retuning the flight model retunes the AI automatically; changing
the stick laws in `flightModel.ts` requires updating `Autopilot.modelLaw`.
Combat outcomes and landing are tested on the real sim (`realsim.test.ts`).

## D-XXX — AI take-off and field landings
**Decision.** Parked aircraft start in phase `takeoff` (level-attitude roll to
1.2 Vs, rotate, climb straight out; wingmen wait 6 s per slot). Landings use a
right-hand pattern when not lined up, a power-off flare that holds heavier types
level until 1.2 Vs, and an aileron/rudder rollout. Flight members land abreast in
lanes 40 m apart, since the fields are open grass.
**Consequences.** Missions can start on the ground (`startOnGround`). The flight
session only needs to set `landed-*` outcomes; `phase === 'landed'` or
`isStoppedOnGround` tells it when.
